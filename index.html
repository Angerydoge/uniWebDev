            <h3>Week 1 - Introduction to Web Development - 5.10.23</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                In the first lecture we mainly learned about the module itself, however we did learn about web development standards, such as document declaration, defining the language and so on. I have decided to use VS Code to make this webpage as I have previously used it and I'm familiar with how it works. The presentation for this week said to find out about web standards and the W3C. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Web standards are the standards set by developers on the web so that developers on the web don’t get confused. Which in itself can sound kind of confusing, basically it’s the standards that the web is made from, like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but other technologies such as Unicode can also be considered a web standard even though wasn’t developed specifically for the web. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also decided to add a little bit of CSS because I really don’t like looking at the browser default text and layout.

            <h3>Week 2 - HTML5 Markup Basics - 12.10.23</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                In the 2nd lecture we mainly focused on basic HTML markup, which I have already done before, however I did pay attention as I am a bit rusty. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Something which I did learn about in this lecture was the use of semantic tags, in older versions of HTML, you used to create things like headers, mains and side bars using divs, in HTML 5 semantics were introduced to provide meaningful tags for the most used elements across the world wide web. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The tutorial for this week said to add lists, navigation and images. Which I had already started doing. I hadn’t yet set up navigation to the contact page, so I did that and added an email link. 
            </p>
            <strong>The Contact Page with email:</strong>

                For this week's independent study, I researched block and inline elements as well as absolute and relative links. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Block elements are elements that start a new line, they will always use up the full width of the viewport (unless CSS is applied). Whereas Inline elements fit into already existing lines, for example the span element can be inserted into a block element, it will only take up necessary space and does not start a new line. 
            </p>
            <strong>Example use of the inline element "span:"</strong>
            <img class="blogImage"src="./images/span.png">
            <p>
                Absolute and Relative links are vital concepts for modern computers and networks, essentially, an absolute link defines the absolute location of something on a computer or network from the root directory, however when using the internet, you cannot know the full directory of anyone device that loads, therefore relative links must be used, this is where the link is relative to the directory the file is in. This means that, for example, a website can be downloaded as a package, that website then has its own relative directory that it uses to link to all the necessary files and other pages it has. 
            </p>
            <strong>For Example:</strong>
            <p>Absolute: C:\Users\me\Desktop\Webdev\uniWebDev\images</p>
            <p>Relative: ./uniWebDev/images</p>
